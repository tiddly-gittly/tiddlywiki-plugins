* Uses standard Reveal widget and PageTemplate
* Integrated with TiddlyWiki palette system for theme compatibility
* Modern CSS with backdrop-filter glass effect and smooth animations
* Document-level event delegation for better performance
* 150ms hover delay to avoid accidental triggers

File changes:

* Added: `startup.js`, `page-template.tid`, `palette-styles.tid`
