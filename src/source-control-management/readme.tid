!! Features

This plugin integrates with [ext[TidGi-Desktop|https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/TidGi-Desktop/]]'s Git version history features, allowing you to:

# Search and browse Git commit history
# View changed files in each commit
# Inspect historical file content
# Restore previous versions of tiddlers

!! Requirements

* Requires [ext[TidGi-Desktop|https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/TidGi-Desktop/]] version 0.13.0 or higher
* Works with Git-backed wikis only

!! Usage

Open the "History" tab in the sidebar to:

# Search Commits: Enter keywords to search commit messages
# Browse History: View the list of commits with author and date
# Inspect Changes: Click on a commit to see changed files
# View Content: Click on a file to see its content at that point in time
# Restore Version: Use the "Apply This Version" button to restore historical content (requires confirmation)

The historical file content is stored in a temporary tiddler and can be opened in the story river for easy editing or copying.

!! Technical Details

This plugin uses TidGi-Desktop's exposed Git APIs to query commit history and file content without requiring external Git commands in the wiki context.
