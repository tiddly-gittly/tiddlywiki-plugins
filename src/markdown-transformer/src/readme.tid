!! Background

[[Web-clipper|https://github.com/webclipper/web-clipper/]] only provides the markdown output, and markdown don't have block level editor [[section-editor|https://github.com/kookma/TW-Section]] support. So we need a way to convert markdown to tiddlywiki's wikitext.

!! Basic Usage

!!! Button on markdown Tiddler Type

If you add filetype `text/x-markdown` to your tiddler, there will be a view toolbar icon show up, which will help you transform markdown to tiddlywiki on clicked.

!! TODO

We use [[Unifiedjs|https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified]]'s [[mdast-util-from-markdown|https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-from-markdown]] to parse md, and use modified version of [[mdast-util-to-markdown|https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-markdown]] to generate tid file. If someday we have a tid parser that generate unified AST, we might be able to generate md file from tid.

!! Developer

This project is based on the [[tiddly-gittly/md-to-tid|https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/md-to-tid]], you might want to take a look and give it a star.
